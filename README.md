----The USN Validator is a software application designed to validate and manage student records based
on their University Seat Number (USN). It provides a user-friendly interface to add, delete, modify,
search, and display student records. The program ensures the accuracy and validity of the USN format,
following a specific pattern defined by the university.
----The USN Validator incorporates regular expressions to validate the USN format, ensuring that it
matches the required pattern. It verifies other input fields such as the student's name, semester, and
email, ensuring that they meet the necessary criteria. By enforcing these validations, the program
maintains data integrity and consistency.
----The main functionalities of the USN Validator include adding new student records, deleting existing
records, modifying student details, searching for specific records, and displaying all stored records.
When adding a new record, the program prompts the user to enter the USN, name, semester, and email.
It validates the entered information and adds the record to the system if all criteria are met.
